This is how this currently works. We start off watching action for RESTART_TIME.

    0          SHIFT_TIME      RESTART_TIME
    |--------------|----------------|

The actions that happen goes into m_Session*Count, those that happen in the second half goes into m_NextSession*Count;

When we reach restart time:

    SHIFT_TIME                  RESTART_TIME
    |--------------|----------------|

And we will be standing in the middle. We'll have some history about the previous APM thanks to  m_NextSession*Count, this will become m_Session*Count.
